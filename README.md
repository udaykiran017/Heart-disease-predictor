🏥 Heart Disease Prediction - Logistic Regression Model  

This project uses Logistic Regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on key health parameters like **age, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate achieved**. The model is trained on a dataset, evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve, and allows real-time user input for prediction.  

🔹 Features Used**: `age`, `cp` (chest pain type), `thalach` (max heart rate)  
🔹 **Model**: Logistic Regression  
🔹 **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC Score  
🔹 **User Interaction**: Predicts heart disease based on user input  
🔹 **Deployment**: The trained model is saved as `heart_disease_model.pkl` using joblib for future use.
